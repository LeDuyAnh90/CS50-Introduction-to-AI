# Background
As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.

In this project, you’ll use TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. To do so, you’ll need a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.

Several such data sets exist, but for this project, we’ll use the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip), which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.

# Understanding
First, take a look at the data set by opening the gtsrb directory. You’ll notice 43 subdirectories in this dataset, numbered 0 through 42. Each numbered subdirectory represents a different category (a different type of road sign). Within each traffic sign’s directory is a collection of images of that type of traffic sign.

Next, take a look at traffic.py. In the main function, we accept as command-line arguments a directory containing the data and (optionally) a filename to which to save the trained model. The data and corresponding labels are then loaded from the data directory (via the load_data function) and split into training and testing sets. After that, the get_model function is called to obtain a compiled neural network that is then fitted on the training data. The model is then evaluated on the testing data. Finally, if a model filename was provided, the trained model is saved to disk.
